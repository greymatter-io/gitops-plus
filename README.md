# greymatter.io Plus CUE

Additional CUE files for greymatter.io mesh configurations.

## Prerequisites

- [CUE CLI](https://cuelang.org/docs/install/)

## Dependencies

This project makes use of git submodules for dependency management. The
<https://github.com/greymatter-io/greymatter-cue> submodule provides the
baseline greymatter.io Control Plane CUE schema.

## Getting Started

Fetch all necessary dependencies:

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap
```

> NOTE: If <https://github.com/greymatter-io/greymatter-cue> is updated, you
> can re-run this script to pull down the latest version.

## Verify CUE configurations

By running the following command, you can do a quick sanity check to
ensure that the CUE evaluates correctly. If you receive any errors, you
will need to fix them before greymatter.io can successfully apply the 
configurations to your mesh.

```sh
cue eval -c EXPORT.cue --out yaml -e configs
```
